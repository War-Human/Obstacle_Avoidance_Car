# Obstacle_Avoidance_Car

The Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Car is a small robot that autonomously navigates while avoiding obstacles. It moves forward until it detects an obstacle in its path. Upon detection, it stops, moves back a little, and then scans left and right to determine the best direction to avoid the obstacle. The car uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure distances and make decisions.

1. Arduino NANO or Uno (any version)
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
3. LM298N Motor Driver Module
4. 5V DC Motors
5. Battery
